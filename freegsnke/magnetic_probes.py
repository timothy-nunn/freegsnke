    Class to implement magnetic probes:
    - flux loops: compute psi(R,Z)
    - pickup coils: compute B(R,phi,Z).nhat (nhat is unit vector orientation of the probe)

    Inputs:
    - equilibrium object - contains grid, plasma profile, plasma and coil currents, coil positions.
    N.B:- in init/setup the eq object only provides machine /domain/position information
        - in methods the equilibrium provides currents and other aspects that evolve in solve().

    Attributes:
    - floops,pickups = dictionaries with name, position, orientation of the probes
    - floops_positions etc.  = extract individual arrays of positions, orientations etc.
    - floops_order / pickups_order = list of fluxloop/pickups names, if individual probe value is required
    - greens_psi_coils_floops = greens functions for psi, evaluated at flux loop positions
    - greens_br/bz_coils_pickups = greens functions for Br/Bz, evaluated at pickup coil positions
    - greens_psi_plasma_floops = dictionary of greens functions for psi from plasma current, evaluated at flux loop positions
    - greens_BrBz_plasma_pickups = dictionary of greens functions for Br and Bz from plasma, evaluated at pickup coil positions

    - more greens function attributes would be added if new probes area added.

    Methods:
    - get_coil_currents(eq): returns current values in all the coils from equilibrium object.
    - get_plasma_current(eq): returns toroidal current values at each plasma grid point, taken from equilibrium input.
    - create_greens_all_coils(): returns array with greens function for each coil and probe combination.
    - psi_all_coils(eq): returns list of psi values at each flux loop position, summed over all coils.
    - psi_from_plasma(eq): returns list of psi values at each flux loop position from plasma itself.
    - create_greens_B_oriented_plasma(eq) : creates oriented greens functions for pickup coils.
    - calculate_fluxloop_value(tokamak, eq): returns total flux at each probe position (sum of previous two outputs).
    - calculate_pickup_value(eq): returns pickup values at each probe position.


    - Br(eq)/ Bz(eq) : computes radial/z component of magnetic field, sum of coil and plasma contributions
    - Btor(eq) : extracts toroidal magnetic field (outside of plasma), evaluated at

    Methods currently have floop or pickup positions as default, but these can be changed with optional argument.
